## Time Visualizer

The start code provide by [Christian Swinehart](http://samizdat.co/) can be found [here](https://dvia.samizdat.co/2019/right-twice-a-day/)

For this project, the data I will be working with are the numerical aspects of time. The `clock()` function provides an access to the current date & time. The function returns a time object with the current instant broken down into individual components. Therefore, I can get numerical values for `hour`, `min`, `sec`, and `ms` on the time side of things and `year`, `season`, `month`, `moon`, `day`, and `weekday` as big units to track time.
