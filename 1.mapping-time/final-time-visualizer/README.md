## Time Visualizer

The start code provide by [Christian Swinehart](http://samizdat.co/) can be found [here](https://dvia.samizdat.co/2019/right-twice-a-day/)

For this project, the data I will be working with are the numerical aspects of time. The `clock()` function provides an access to the current date & time. The function returns a time object with the current instant broken down into individual components. Therefore, I can get numerical values for `hour`, `min`, `sec`, and `ms` on the time side of things and `year`, `season`, `month`, `moon`, `day`, and `weekday` as big units to track time.

This final version of the hygrid clock 'Time Visualizer' was inspired by multiple elements such us solar system, orbital revolution, the representative of each season, and dial plate.

Time Units: season, a.m., p.m., hour, minute, second

Retinal Variables: position, value, hue, orientation
