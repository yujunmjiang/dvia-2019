## Time Visualizer

The start code provide by [Christian Swinehart](http://samizdat.co/) can be found [here](https://dvia.samizdat.co/2019/right-twice-a-day/)

For this project, the data I will be working with are the numerical aspects of time. The `clock()` function provides an access to the current date & time. The function returns a time object with the current instant broken down into individual components. Therefore, I can get numerical values for `hour`, `min`, `sec`, and `ms` on the time side of things and `year`, `season`, `month`, `moon`, `day`, and `weekday` as big units to track time.

As the ispiration base on date 01, the combinatiion of position, color, and orientation shows how 24 hours change in the triangle (both right and left sides). Beyond the daytime and nighttime, the another triangle displays four seasons. Also, the circle in the middle tracks lunar phase as well.

Time Units: season, a.m., p.m., hour, minute, second

Retinal Variables: position, value, hue, orientation
