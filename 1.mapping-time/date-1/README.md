The big rectangle in the top-left corner represents four seasons by diffetent color in one year. The rest of seven small isometrical rectangle calculates week day and weekend as a loop. Meanwhile, the color in each small rectangle devides daytime and nighttime in two colors.

Retinal Variables: size, value, hue

In the revised design, I used one of retinal vatiables (grey) value to represent the differences between hour, minute, and second. Meanwhile, the size of each rectangle shows the current progress of time.
