Three bars represent hour, minute, and second in the horizontal direction. The percentage of black and white colors translate 24 hours into visual language. The horizontal gradient is an expression of sunrise and sunset in the nature.

Retinal Variables: position, size, value

In the revised design, I used one of retinal vatiables (grey) value to represent the differences between hour, minute, and second. Meanwhile, the size of each rectangle shows the current progress of time.
