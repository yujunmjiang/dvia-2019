#### Sketch

As the ispiration base on date 01, the combinatiion of position, color, and orientation shows how 24 hours change in the triangle (both right and left sides). Beyond the daytime and nighttime, the another triangle displays four seasons. Also, the circle in the middle tracks lunar phase as well.

Retinal Variables: position, value, hue, orientation

#### Revised Design

In the revised design, I used both size and hue to represent Earth and Moon. The background color devided daytime and nighttime in two colors. The orientation of Moon matched with lunar phase in each month. Also, the orbit's colors visualized four seasons by hues.
