As the ispiration base on date 01, the combinatiion of position, color, and orientation shows how 24 hours change in the triangle (both right and left sides). Beyond the daytime and nighttime, the another triangle displays four seasons. Also, the circle in the middle tracks lunar phase as well.

Retinal Variables: position, value, hue, orientation

#### Revised Design

In the revised design, I devided each year in the first and second half by the orientation of triangle. Meanwhile, four different colors matched seasons in the triangle (both right and left sides). The percent of circle in the middle conveyed lunar phase in each month.
